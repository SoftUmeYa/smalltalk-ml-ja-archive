----------------------------------------------------------------------

For the past 18 years, the European Smalltalk User Group (ESUG) has
organised the International Smalltalk Conference, a lively forum on
cutting edge software technologies that attract people from both
academia and industry for a whole week. The attendees are both
engineers using Smalltalk in business and students and teachers
using Smalltalk both for research and didactic purposes.

As every year, this year's edition of the largest European Smalltalk
event will include the regular Smalltalk developers conference with
renowned invited speakers, a Smalltalk camp that proves fruitful for
interactions and discussions. Besides, this year will be held the
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;- 6th edition of the Innovation Technology Awards where prizes will be
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;awarded to authors of best pieces of Smalltalk-related projects
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;- &#160;an international workshop on Smalltalk and dynamic languages
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<A HREF="http://www.esug.org/Conferences/2010/International+Workshop+on+Smalltalk+Technologies">http://www.esug.org/Conferences/2010/International+Workshop+on+Smalltalk+Technologies</A>
