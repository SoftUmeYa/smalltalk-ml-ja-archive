Dear all,

can you promote this announce (see below) among your network (students or
young lecturers can apply also) ?
Our annual ESUG (European Smalltalk User Group) conference will take in
charge meals, accomodations and the cost of the conference fees (around 600
euros). Students have to pay only for the travel. See details below.

More details about the 2018 conference are here:
https://esug.github.io/2018-Conference/conf2018.html

Thank you.
Regards,

Call for Student Volunteers

Student volunteers help keep the conference running smoothly; in return,
they have free accommodations, while still having most of the time to enjoy
the conference.

Pay attention: the places are limited so do not wait till the last minute
to apply.
Conference details:

Send an email to stephane.ducasse at inria.fr and serge.stinckwich at
gmail.com with:

   - title: [ESUG 2018 Student]
   - name, gender, university/school, country, email address
   - short description of you and why you are interested in participating

*For which period is accommodation covered?* Accommodation is covered from
Sunday 9 to 15, September 2018 (including nights from Sunday to Monday and
from Thursday to Friday). Students will be hosted in student rooms. ESUG
additionally covers for the lunches during the week and one dinner.

Duties include handling registration as people arrive at the conference,
filling coffee machines, collecting presentation slides for ESUG right
after the presentation is given, being present at an information desk to
answer questions, and generally being helpful. Student volunteering makes
the conference better, takes a fairly small amount of time and doesn't
significantly interfere with enjoying and learning from the conference.
Please Note, this role requires discipline and constant attention to all
attendees.
Information about hotel

The students will be hosted at the dormitory of the Universita' Degli Studi
di Cagliari Via S. Giorgio, 12/3, nel polo Aresu, 09124 Cagliari CA, Italia
