To: pharo-dev ＠ lists.pharo.org


Hello Pharo-ers !

On behalf of the community, I would like to thank each one of you for their
significant contribution in the previously concluded *Google Summer of Code
2017* with *Pharo Consortium*. We aspire to take-off on a long flight after
this successful stint by applying to participate in the upcoming *Google
Summer of Code 2018*.

As many of you might know, Google Summer of Code is a global program focused
on bringing more student developers into open source software development.
Students work with an open source organization on a 3 month programming
project during their break from school. Read more about the program here:
https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/

The deadline for organisations to apply is January 23, 2018 which is fast
approaching. As an open source evangelist and a Pharo developer, I would
like to invite all the experienced members to be a part of the "GSoC 2018
with Pharo Consortium" Team and mentor students. Propose fresh ideas for
projects which shall help improve Pharo or volunteer to mentor any of the
existing one (Listed here: http://gsoc.pharo.org/). To add your own project
idea to the list, visit http://gsoc.pharo.org/#adding-a-proposal

Looking forward to an appreciable representation from the Pharo community.

Best regards
Jigyasa Grover
Pharo Consortium Org Admin, Google Summer of Code 2017 [hidden email]
