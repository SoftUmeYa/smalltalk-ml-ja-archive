engineers using Smalltalk in business and students and teachers using
Smalltalk both for research and didactic purposes.

This year's edition of the largest European Smalltalk event will
include:

&#160; &#160; &#160; - The regular Smalltalk developers conference with
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; renowned invited speakers

&#160; &#160; &#160; - a Smalltalk camp that proved fruitful for interactions and
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; discussions (August 25-26)

&#160; &#160; &#160; - 9th edition of the Innovation Technology Awards where prizes
