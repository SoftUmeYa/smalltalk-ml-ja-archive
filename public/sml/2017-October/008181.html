Hello Pharo-ers !

On behalf of the community, I would like to thank each one of you for their
significant contribution in the recently concluded *Google Summer of Code
2017* with *Pharo Consortium*. We aspire to take-off on a long flight after
this successful stint. In this spirit, I proposed at ESUG 2017 that we take
part in the upcoming *Google Code-In 2017*.

GCI is a contest to introduce pre-university students (ages 13-17) to open
source software development. Because Google Code-in is often the first
experience many students have with open source, the contest is designed to
make it easy for students to jump right in with /bite-sized tasks/ (3 to 5
days) having categorised as: Code, Documentation/Training,
Outreach/Research, Quality Assurance, or User Interface.

Students search for a task from the list created by us that interests them
and claim it. They have at least three days to complete it. The student
works on the task, getting guidance from mentors, if needed. Once the
student is ready, they submit their work for review through the contest
website. Mentors from the organisation evaluate the work, provide feedback,
and if it's complete, accept it so that student can claim a new task.
Otherwise, specific feedback is provided, and the student goes back to
improving it.

Participants who complete at least 1 task get a digital certificate.
Participants who complete 3 or more tasks receive a t-shirt too. At the end
of the contest, each organisation chooses five finalists to receive limited
edition Google Code-in hoodies. Two finalists from each organisation get to
be the grand prize winners and go on a trip to Google Headquarters in
California !

The contest runs for about 6-8 weeks in December &amp; January generally. With
organisation applications beginning in October/November, we need to be well
prepared for this season’s application with a hope to get selected.

As an open source evangelist and a Pharo developer, I would like to invite
all the experienced members to be a part of the &quot;GCI with Pharo Consortium&quot;
Team and mentor students. To get added to the “private repository”  (we need
to keep prospective students away from the task list before the program
begins &#128521; ) where you can put in your tasks/suggestions kindly EMail me or
any of the previously added mentor.

Looking forward to an appreciable representation from the Pharo community.

Best regards
Jigyasa Grover
