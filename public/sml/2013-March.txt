Hi all,

As every year, Google launched its "Google Summer of
Code " initiative from June to September 2013.
Google Summer of Code is a global program that offers student
developers stipends (5000 US dollars) to write code for various open
source software projects during summer (3 months). A unique
opportunity for students to participate in the development of free
software.

More details are available online here:
http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013

I am the co-admin of GSOC 2013 for ESUG (European
Smalltalk User Group) community and we will propose the March 29,
2013, projects for students in the context of the GSOC 2013 program.

If you are a student and you want to discover a new programming
language (Smalltalk) do not hesitate to contact me.

You can also visit our website:
http://gsoc2013.esug.org/

and join the mailing list for students:
http://groups.google.com/group/smalltalk-gsoc-students

Students will have to choose their project between April 22 and May 3, 2013

About this release
------------------
All in all, there were over 1600 issues treated in the issue tracker
and 1350 improvements integrated into 2.0.

http://code.google.com/p/pharo/issues/list?can=1&q=Milestone%3D2.0+status%3AIntegrated

Read it again, yes 1350 is huge, take two minutes and have a look at the list of
improvements! Now you got the feel of the effort. And this was a true community
effort. It is possible because people worldwide helped! We want to
deeply thank them.

We want to thank Inria for its constant support, in particular for the
salary of Igor
Stasenko and Esteban Lorenzano, and for the help in the infrastructure.

We have accomplished this huge task for a better system because we
were together. Do not
forget that we are working on a consortium to support our system:

- http://consortium.pharo.org (for companies and organizations)
- http://association.pharo.org (for individuals)

Our goal is to build a system so that we can make a living with our
creativity and
programming skills.

You can find information about Pharo on http://www.pharo-project.org.
In particular,
you may be interested in:

- Joining us and getting help http://www.pharo-project.org/community
- Getting the Pharo By Example book (available as a free PDF):
http://www.pharobyexample.org
- Watching the screencasts http://www.pharocasts.com
- Reporting problems http://www.pharo-project.org/community/issue-tracking
- Reading the forth coming book http://rmod.lille.inria.fr/pbe2

Thanks a lot for your participation, energy and fun.
