こんにちは
梅澤です。

定例のSmalltalk勉強会のお知らせです。

日時: 2013/2/22(金) 19:00-21:00 (2時間)
場所: シンコム・システムズ・ジャパン株式会社
テキスト:「自由自在Squeakプログラミング」 「Smalltalkで学ぶオブジェクト指向プログラミングの本質」
詳しくは下記をどうぞ。
http://www.smalltalk-users.jp/Home/gao-zhi/dai51kaismalltalkbenkyoukai

今回は2年ぶりにF-Scriptです。F-ScriptはいわばCocoa
Smalltalkと呼べるもので、CocoaのオブジェクトをSmalltalkライクなメッセージ送信で操れる、動的でクールな言語です。

実は先日F-Scriptの日本語サイトができあがりました。今回はサイトを作成された芳賀さん自身にお話いただけることになっています!

事前申し込み等は不要です。お気軽にお越しください。

Dyla'13, 7th Workshop on Dynamic Languages and Applications
Colocated with ECOOP, ECMFA and ECSA
1?5 July, Montpellier, France

http://rmod.lille.inria.fr/web/pier/Events/Dyla13

!! Important dates

- Submission deadline:  April 19th
- Notification: mid-May
- Workshop: July 1st
- Ecoop early registration: mid-May

!! Abstract

The advent of Java and C# has been a major breakthrough in the
adoption of some important object-oriented language characteristics.
This breakthrough turned academic features like interfaces, garbage
collection, and meta-programming into technologies generally accepted
by industry. Nevertheless, the massive adoption of these languages now
also gives rise to a growing awareness of their limitations. A number
of reactions from industry testify this: invokedynamic bytecode
instruction has been included in latest Java virtual machine release;
the dynamic language runtime (DLR) is gaining popularity; C# adopted
dynamic as a valid static type. Gartner prognoses further growth
(http://blogs.gartner.com/mark_driver/2008/12/10) of dynamic
languages.

Researchers and practitioners struggle with static type systems,
overly complex abstract grammars, simplistic concurrency mechanisms,
limited reflection capabilities, and the absence of higher-order
language constructs such as delegation, closures and continuations.
Dynamic languages such as Ruby, Python, JavaScript and Lua are a step
forward in addressing these problems while getting more and more
popular. Making these languages mainstream requires practitioners to
look back and pick mechanisms up in existing dynamic languages such as
Lisp, Scheme, Smalltalk and Self. Practitioners also need to further
explore discover new dynamic approaches in the context of new
challenging fields such as pervasive computing.

The goal of this workshop is to act as a forum where practitioners can
discuss new advances in the design, implementation and application of
dynamically typed languages that, sometimes radically, diverge from
the statically typed class-based mainstream. Another objective is to
discuss new as well as older "forgotten" languages and features in
this context. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- programming language extensions
- programming environment extensions
- executing environments
- static and dynamic analyses
- optional type-checking
- meta-object protocols
- reserve engineering
- domain-specific languages/tooling
- testing environments
- live programming

!! Targeted audience

The expected audience of this workshop is practitioners and
researchers sharing the same interest in dynamically typed languages.
Lua, Python, Ruby, Scheme and Smalltalk are gaining a significant
popularity both in industry and academia. Nevertheless, each community
has the tendency to only look at what it produces. Broadening the
scope of each community is the goal of the workshop. To achieve this
goal we will form a PC with leading persons from all languages
mentioned above, fostering participation from all targeted
communities.

!! Workshop Format and Submission Information

The workshop will have a demo-oriented style. The idea is to allow
participants to demonstrate new and interesting features and discuss
what they feel is relevant for the dynamic-language community. To
participate to the workshop, you can either

- submit (before __April 19th 2013__) an article (ACM Tighter
Alternate style
http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates) describing
your presentation and/or tool. Articles whose length ranges from 2 to
15 pages will be carefully reviewed by a program committee including
but not limited to the organizers. Each accepted paper will be
presented for 20 to 30 minutes and be published to the ACM Digital
Library (at the option of each author) and the workshop's web site.
The submission website is
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=dyla2013.

- or give a 10-minute lightning demo of your work. A dedicated session
will be allocated for this, provided there is ample time available.

A session on pair programming is also planned. People will then get a
chance to share their technologies by interacting with other
participants.
