CALL FOR PAPERS AND WORKSHOP PROPOSALS

The Fifth International Conference on
Creating, Connecting and Collaborating through Computing (C5 2007)

January 24 - 26, 2007, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan
<A HREF="http://www.cm.is.ritsumei.ac.jp/c5-07/">http://www.cm.is.ritsumei.ac.jp/c5-07/</A>

Organized by
Hewlett-Packard Company
Kyoto University 21st Century COE Program for Knowledge Society Infrastructure
Viewpoints Research Institute

SCOPE

  Computers, networks, and other forms of technology are now pervasive
  in our information-based society. However, most users still function
  as passive consumers of technology. To evolve into a true knowledge
  society, it is critical that we transform computer-based human
  activities to engage users in the active process of creating,
  connecting, and collaborating together.

  The C5 conference is for researchers, technology developers,
  educators, and technology users who are concerned about developing
  and enabling human-oriented creation, connection, and collaboration
  processes. C5 is an international forum for presenting ongoing work
  as well as new work currently under development and for discussing
  future needs and directions in creative computing and multimedia
  authoring environments. We welcome equally the submission of
  technical papers and practitioner/experience reports for paper
  presentations. In addition, we are adding a workshop track for the
  third day of the conference and are soliciting proposals for half-day
  and full-day interactive workshops.

TOPICS OF INTEREST

  Topics of interest include but not limited to
  - Development and applications of collaboration tools and environments
  - User collaboration utilizing 3D, multimedia, and animation objects
  - Technologies for creating educational environments
  - Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) and
    Technology-Enabled Learning (TEL)
  - Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), distributed work, and
    virtual teaming
  - Hybrid technology activities, such as scientific experiments,
    instrumentation, robots, and game playing
  - Development of applications/content for non traditional learning
    environments, e.g. mentoring, peer-to-peer, &quot;teacherless&quot;
    environments (in developing countries), e.g., $100 laptop
  - Applications and tools for education from K-12 through higher education

PAPER SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

  Original papers concerned with both theory and practice are solicited.

  A full paper with 8 page limit should be submitted by the paper
  submission deadline. The papers are reviewed by the program comittee
  and authors will be notified about acceptance. Accepted authors have
  to submit a camera ready version of the full paper with 8 page limit
  by the camera-ready copy deadline.  Papers should follow the
  formatting instructions provided by 8.5&quot; x 11&quot;, Two-Column Format of
  &quot;IEEE Computer Society Press - Proceedings Author Guidelines&quot; (please
  refer to &quot;INFORMATION FOR AUTHORS&quot; at
  <A HREF="http://www.computer.org/portal/site/cscps/index.jsp">http://www.computer.org/portal/site/cscps/index.jsp</A>).

  Submitted papers and camera-ready papers should be sent
  electronically through our online submission site
  (<A HREF="http://www.cm.is.ritsumei.ac.jp/c5-07/myreview/">http://www.cm.is.ritsumei.ac.jp/c5-07/myreview/</A>). The PDF,
  Postscript and MS-WORD formats are acceptable.

WORKSHOP PROPOSAL GUIDELINES

  The third day of the conference (Jan. 26, 2007) has been allotted 
for workshops
  and field trips. The workshop day is intended to offer conference participants
  the opportunity to learn more about human-oriented creation, 
connection, and collaboration
  processes and tools through interactive group experiences. Workshops 
allow conference
  participants to apply what they have learned in the plenary sessions 
and paper presentations
  through hands-on activities, facilitated discussions, and field 
trips to schools and sites
  offering technology-enabled learning activities.

  Workshop proposals should include workshop title, description of
  topic, workshop organizers, workshop duration (half-day or full-day)
  and estimated expenses (printing, etc.). Proposals should be sent to
  the conference contact e-mail address indicated at the conference web
  page.

IMPORTANT DATES
  Full paper submission: October 16, 2006
  Workshop proposals: October 30, 2006
  Notification of acceptance: November 30, 2006
  Full paper camera-ready copies: January 7, 2007
  Proposals for demos and posters: January 7, 2007

PUBLICATION
  Preliminary version of the proceedings will be distributed during the
  conference. The formal version of the proceedings will be published
  by the IEEE Computer Society and sent to authors after the
  conference.
